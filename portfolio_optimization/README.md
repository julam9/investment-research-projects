# 📈 Portfolio Optimization using the Markowitz Model

This project based on **Modern Portfolio Theory** (1952) by Markowitz since it is considered as pioneer method of constructing portfolio. This method used to find **optimal weights** of each asset in a portfolio. There are two things considered in this method :
- Portfolio Risk
- Portfolio Return

## 🚀 Features 
:heavy_check_mark: Take **stock price data** using yahoo finance API
:heavy_check_mark: Calculate the **expected return and risk** of portfolio
:heavy_check_mark: Generates **10000 random portfolios** to visualize the random frontier 
:heavy_check_mark: SciPy optimization for **optimal weights**
:heavy_check_mark: Plot the **efficient frontier** to show risk-return *tradeoff*

## 📊 **Efficient Frontier**
The red star (⭐) shows the *optimal* portfolio with the best risk-return
